# No Sit While Chat
Original description:
* Are you a film maker and get annoyed when your sims sit down mid recording? Are you someone that just gets annoyed when you want your sims to talk while standing?
* Then this is the perfect mod for you! It's just as simple as that, to be honest.

The author 'TAESimmer' lost interest in The Sims 4 and will very likely not update the mod which is broken.
